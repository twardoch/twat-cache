# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

Due to GitHub App permissions restrictions, the workflow files could not be automatically committed. Please manually add these workflow files to complete the CI/CD setup:

## Required Workflow Files

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
This file provides continuous integration testing on all platforms.

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Update)
The existing release workflow has been enhanced for multiplatform support.

## Manual Setup Instructions

1. **Create/Update CI Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Create the CI workflow file
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Update Release Workflow**:
   The existing `.github/workflows/release.yml` should be updated to include multiplatform testing.

## Workflow Features

### CI Workflow Features:
- **Multiplatform Testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Quality Checks**: Linting, type checking, security scanning
- **Test Coverage**: Full test suite with coverage reporting

### Release Workflow Features:
- **Automated Testing**: Full test suite on all platforms
- **Build Artifacts**: Source distribution and wheel
- **PyPI Publishing**: Automatic publishing on git tags
- **GitHub Releases**: Automated release creation with artifacts

## Alternative: Manual Workflow Management

If you prefer to manage workflows manually, you can:

1. Use the existing CI/CD workflows as they are
2. Create releases using the local scripts:
   ```bash
   make release        # Create patch release
   make release-minor  # Create minor release
   make release-major  # Create major release
   ```

## Permissions Required

To enable automatic workflow management, the GitHub App would need:
- `workflows: write` permission
- `contents: write` permission (already enabled)

## Next Steps

1. Manually add the workflow files to `.github/workflows/`
2. Test the CI pipeline with a pull request
3. Test the release pipeline with a version tag
4. Verify PyPI publishing works correctly

The build system is fully functional without the workflow files - they just provide automated CI/CD integration.
