# twat-cache TODO List

## Phase 1

- [ ] Implement a strategy for choosing the right cache backend for the right type of data as detailed in @NEXT.md, then proceed with other items in @TODO.md

## Phase 2

- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints validation with mypy to ensure type safety across the codebase
- [ ] Add graceful fallback mechanisms when preferred engines are unavailable
- [ ] Fix any potential race conditions in concurrent cache access
- [ ] Ensure thread safety in all cache operations
- [ ] Implement proper signal handling for clean shutdown
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all cache engines and decorators
- [ ] Add logging for cache operations (hits, misses, etc.)
- [ ] Improve configuration validation

## Current Focus

- [ ] Resolve type compatibility issues in context.py with CacheConfig protocol
- [ ] Expand test coverage for cache engines
- [ ] Create documentation for cache context management
- [ ] Implement Redis cache engine
- [ ] Address linter errors in engine implementations (diskcache, klepto)
- [ ] Work on graceful fallback mechanisms when preferred engines are unavailable

## Code Quality and Structure

- [ ] Refactor common patterns across engine implementations into shared utilities
- [ ] Standardize engine initialization and validation procedures
