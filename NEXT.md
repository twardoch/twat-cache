# Data Type-Based Cache Backend Selection Strategy

## 1. Introduction

The `twat_cache` library supports multiple caching backends, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This document outlines a strategy for selecting the most appropriate cache backend based on the type of data being cached. This strategy aims to optimize performance, memory usage, and reliability for different data types.

## 2. Available Cache Backends

Based on the codebase, we support the following cache backends:

1. **functools** - Simple in-memory caching using Python's built-in `functools.lru_cache`
2. **cachetools** - Flexible in-memory caching with multiple eviction policies
3. **diskcache** - Persistent disk-based caching with SQLite backend
4. **joblib** - Specialized caching for scientific computing (NumPy arrays, pandas DataFrames)
5. **klepto** - Advanced caching with multiple backends and policies
6. **aiocache** - Async-compatible caching
7. **cachebox** - High-performance caching

## 3. Data Type Characteristics

Different types of data have different characteristics that make them more suitable for certain cache backends:

### 3.1. Size
- **Small data** (<10KB): Simple strings, numbers, small dictionaries/lists
- **Medium data** (10KB-1MB): Larger collections, medium-sized images, medium JSON objects
- **Large data** (1MB-100MB): Large datasets, images, serialized models
- **Very large data** (>100MB): Video files, very large datasets, complex ML models

### 3.2. Serialization Complexity
- **Simple**: Basic Python types (int, float, str, bool)
- **Moderate**: Lists, dictionaries with simple values, custom classes with simple attributes
- **Complex**: Nested objects, custom classes with many attributes, objects with circular references
- **Specialized**: NumPy arrays, pandas DataFrames, scientific computing objects, ML models

### 3.3. Access Patterns
- **Read-heavy**: Data that is read frequently but written rarely
- **Write-heavy**: Data that is updated frequently
- **Balanced**: Similar read and write frequencies
- **Temporal locality**: Data accessed in clusters over time
- **Spatial locality**: Related data items accessed together

### 3.4. Persistence Requirements
- **Ephemeral**: Only needed during program execution
- **Session-persistent**: Needed across multiple runs in a session
- **Long-term persistent**: Needed across multiple sessions/days

### 3.5. Concurrency Requirements
- **Single-threaded**: No concurrent access
- **Multi-threaded**: Concurrent access from multiple threads
- **Multi-process**: Concurrent access from multiple processes
- **Distributed**: Concurrent access from multiple machines

## 4. Backend Selection Strategy

### 4.1. Default Backend Selection by Data Type

| Data Type | Recommended Backend | Alternative Backend | Justification |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Simple Python types** (int, str, bool) | cachetools | functools | Efficient in-memory storage, low overhead |
| **Collections** (list, dict, set) | cachetools | klepto | Flexible policies, good performance for medium collections |
| **NumPy arrays** | joblib | diskcache | Optimized for NumPy arrays, efficient serialization |
| **Pandas DataFrames** | joblib | diskcache | Optimized for pandas objects, handles large datasets well |
| **Images/Binary data** | diskcache | klepto | Efficient storage of binary data on disk |
| **Large JSON objects** | diskcache | klepto | Persistent storage, good for structured data |
| **Machine Learning models** | joblib | diskcache | Specialized serialization, handles large binary objects |
| **Custom classes** | klepto | diskcache | Flexible serialization options |
| **Async coroutine results** | aiocache | cachetools | Designed for async compatibility |

### 4.2. Selection by Data Characteristics

#### 4.2.1. By Size

| Data Size | Recommended Backend | Justification |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Small** (<10KB) | cachetools | Fast in-memory access, low overhead |
| **Medium** (10KB-1MB) | klepto or diskcache | Good balance of performance and memory usage |
| **Large** (1MB-100MB) | diskcache or joblib | Efficient disk storage, specialized serialization |
| **Very large** (>100MB) | joblib | Optimized for large scientific data |

#### 4.2.2. By Persistence Requirements

| Persistence Need | Recommended Backend | Justification |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Ephemeral** | cachetools or functools | Fast in-memory caching, no disk overhead |
| **Session-persistent** | klepto or diskcache | Can persist to disk but still relatively fast |
| **Long-term persistent** | diskcache | Reliable SQL-based storage, data survives restarts |

#### 4.2.3. By Access Pattern

| Access Pattern | Recommended Backend | Policy Setting | Justification |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Read-heavy** | Any backend | LRU policy | Standard caching approach |
| **Write-heavy** | cachetools or diskcache | Small maxsize | Prevent cache thrashing |
| **Temporal locality** | cachetools | LRU policy | Optimized for recently used items |
| **Frequency-based** | cachetools or klepto | LFU policy | Keeps frequently accessed items |
| **Random access** | klepto | RR (Random Replacement) | Simple eviction suitable for random patterns |

#### 4.2.4. By Concurrency Requirements

| Concurrency Need | Recommended Backend | Justification |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Single-threaded** | Any backend | All work well in this simple case |
| **Multi-threaded** | cachetools or diskcache | Thread-safe implementations |
| **Multi-process** | diskcache | Shared storage accessible across processes |
| **Distributed** | diskcache with network path | Can be accessed from multiple machines |

### 4.3. Implementation Approach

To implement this strategy in the `twat_cache` library, we recommend:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Analyze the return type of cached functions to suggest an appropriate backend.
   
2. **Configuration Helpers**: Provide helper functions for common data types:
   ```python
   # Example API
   from twat_cache import configure_for_numpy, configure_for_json, configure_for_images
   
   @cache(config=configure_for_numpy())
   def process_array(data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
       # Process the array
       return result
   ```

3. **Smart Defaults**: When no specific engine is requested, select based on:
   - Function return type annotations if available
   - Runtime analysis of actual returned values
   - Configuration hints like `maxsize` and `folder_name`

4. **Hybrid Caching**: For functions that return different types based on input:
   ```python
   @cache(config=hybrid_cache_config(
       small_result_engine="cachetools",
       large_result_engine="diskcache",
       size_threshold=1024*1024  # 1MB
   ))
   def get_data(id: str) -> dict | bytes:
       # Returns either metadata (dict) or raw data (bytes)
       # The appropriate cache will be selected based on return size
   ```

## 5. Implementation Plan

1. Add a data type analyzer utility to inspect function returns
2. Create configuration factory functions for common data types
3. Implement smart backend selection based on data characteristics
4. Add hybrid caching capability for mixed-return functions
5. Update documentation with examples of type-based configuration

## 6. Conclusion

By matching data types to appropriate cache backends, we can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the caching system. This strategy provides a framework for making these decisions systematically, whether manually configured by users or automatically determined by the library.

The core principle is: **Let the data characteristics guide the cache backend selection.**
