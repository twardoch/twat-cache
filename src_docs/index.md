**Part of the [TWAT](https://pypi.org/project/twat/) framework** - A collection of advanced Python utilities.

## üöÄ What is TWAT-Cache?

TWAT-Cache is a versatile and high-performance Python library that simplifies caching for your applications. It provides a unified interface to various caching backends through simple decorators, allowing you to dramatically improve performance without significant code changes.

### Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-speedometer: **High Performance**
    
    Minimal overhead with support for multiple high-performance backends including Rust-based engines

- :material-puzzle: **Multiple Backends**
    
    Choose from in-memory, disk-based, file-based, or async caching with automatic fallback

- :material-cog: **Flexible Configuration**
    
    Fine-grained control over cache size, TTL, eviction policies, and compression

- :material-api: **Simple API**
    
    One decorator to rule them all - just add `@ucache` to your functions

- :material-sync: **Async Support**
    
    First-class support for async/await with dedicated async cache decorators

- :material-shield-check: **Type Safe**
    
    Full type hints and runtime validation with Pydantic

## üì¶ Quick Installation

=== "Basic"

    ```bash
    pip install twat-cache
    ```
    
    Includes in-memory and disk caching capabilities.

=== "With All Backends"

    ```bash
    pip install "twat-cache[all]"
    ```
    
    Includes all optional backends for maximum flexibility.

=== "Development"

    ```bash
    pip install "twat-cache[dev,test]"
    ```
    
    Includes development and testing tools.

## üéØ Quick Start

Here's how simple it is to add caching to your Python functions:

```python
from twat_cache import ucache

@ucache  # That's it! Your function is now cached
def expensive_computation(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """This result will be cached automatically."""
    return x ** y + sum(range(x * y))

# First call computes and caches
result = expensive_computation(5, 3)  # Takes time

# Subsequent calls are instant!
result = expensive_computation(5, 3)  # Returns immediately from cache
```

### Async Functions? No Problem!

```python
from twat_cache import acache
import asyncio

@acache
async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Async functions are cached just as easily."""
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()

# Use it naturally
data = await fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
```
